# PHP Developer
Are you an expert programmer who can build and maintain our back-end system? Can you write robust, high-quality code? Are you an ace with API? Then we could be looking at our new PHP Developer…

## Who are we?
As Continental Europe’s leading online food delivery service, here at Takeaway.com we’re always looking to bring the very best to the table. With orders flying in from customers in 11 countries, we need an expert to create and maintain our back-end systems.

Our Enschede office is a hub for tech talent and IT specialists. Based in a lively part of the city, close to a range of amenities and within walking distance of Enschede Central station, we think it could be the best spot in town.

## What you'll do:
As our Back-End Developer, you will be maintaining and implementing new features on our RESTful API. That means providing the specifications that underpin our website and apps – optimised for a range of countries. You’ll be working in an Agile environment and will be a key ingredient in our cross-functional team.

Producing high-performing and robust PHP code is also a central part of this role. As well as creating our web server, the task of maintaining it and improving PHP performance is in your hands. You’ll also be setting up a range of important – and often complex - queries in MySQL.

While these are the main courses of your role at Takeaway.com, there’s plenty more variety on the side. Our PHP Developer will also be undertaking unit tests for CI systems and making decisions on how and when to use dependency injection.

## Are you the one?
