# Senior React Developer

Want to help build a new platform for a world known brand? Enjoy working in cutting-edge Frontend technology? Looking for a role with plenty of chance to develop? Then we’ve got the job for you…

## Who we are
Serving customers from Amsterdam to Tel Aviv, we’re proud to be Continental Europe’s leading online food delivery service. But just like our delivery drivers, we never stand still. Based in our tech hub in Netherlands’ Enschede, our React Developer has an inspiring base from which to produce innovative work.

## What you'll do
You’re tasked with helping rewrite the Takeaway.com platform from scratch, using modern Frontend tech stack. We processed over 90 million orders last year, and now we’re looking to migrate and grow our platform. You’ll be helping improve existing features and adding new ones.

While you’ll be learning skills on the job, prior experience with React.js combined with Redux would help you hit the ground running. We’re also hoping you can combine your tech skills with a knack for problem-solving and an ability to deal with matters like performance budgets.

As a good team player, you’re as confident debating technical ideas as you are using the Domain Driven Design (DDD) approach. Our Frontend Developer needs to be a natural collaborator who works effectively with other teams – including Backend, Product, Design, CloudOps and Analytics.

awesome. But we’re also looking for someone with…

- Experience with Redux-Saga / React Native / Next.js is a plus
- Experience with Jest is a plus
