# Senior Test Automation Engineer

Know how to develop an excellent QA strategy? Able to add expertise to our software development life cycle? Want to join an innovative global company? Then we could be looking for you…

## Who are we?
From perfect pizzas to sumptuous salads, we’re uniting our customers with the food they love. Right now, Takeaway.com are delivering tasty treats in around 100 cities – from Tilburg to Tel Aviv.

Based in our Enschede tech hub (did we mention the new office?!), our Test Automation Engineer will add another crucial ingredient to our strategy with their continuous testing skills.

## What you'll do:
As a senior engineer, you’ll develop our test automation framework. This gives you the chance to clearly define what needs accomplishing and the testing approach to reach your goals. But you won’t be the only chef in the kitchen. You’ll also work closely with developers to create and review tests for new features.

With your hands-on approach, you’re able to play a major part in our software development life cycle (SDLC). In addition to helping produce high-quality, low-cost software, you’re also involved in non-functional testing, to ensure our systems and applications are working nicely.

Being a senior member of the team, you’ll also mentor other engineers. As well as developing their ability to expand and use test automation solutions, you’ll be guiding them through matters like risk assessment. If you want a role which combines tech and teaching, this is it!

## Are you the one?
So, you’re an automated testing ace who can help our team reach the next level? We like you already. But we’re also looking for…

- 5+ years experience in QA automation roles
- Background in REST API test automation and REST testing tools like REST Assured, ReadyAPI, Postman or Katalon
- Knowledge of how to run a REST API test automation in a pipeline using tools like GitLab CI, Travis CI or Jenkins
- Ability to test the performance of a REST API
- Fluent English language skills
- Knowledge of PHP is an advantage

## Here's our offer:
You know it. We know it. Behind every great company is a talented tech team. And we reckon that kind of expertise deserves proper rewards.

You’ll get a competitive salary, but that’s just for starters. We’re also serving up top events like our annual snow holiday and summer party. And there’s a sociable, collaborative vibe in our Enschede office that we’re pretty proud of.
